Project Summary
This project is a comprehensive web application designed to manage users, books, pricing, and subscriptions for a book rental and school management system. It incorporates various modern technologies like Java, Node.js, Redis, React, and Material UI to create an interactive, secure, and efficient user experience for two distinct client groups: students and schools.

Technologies and Architecture: The core functionality of the application is built using Java for backend user management and book library management. It allows administrators (admins) to manage books, set pricing, and offer various subscription plans. Schools and students can access the system through a web frontend built with React and Material UI, providing a smooth and responsive interface.

Node.js is used to manage backend services, and Redis is utilized to handle user session management and improve the performance of real-time data retrieval. The app supports user authentication, verification processes, and profile switching, ensuring that each user is appropriately served based on their profile type (admin, student, or school).

React is employed in the frontend to offer dynamic and seamless user experiences. The state management is done using React's useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks, which ensures that the application remains responsive and performs optimally. The front-end interface is designed with Material UI (MUI), ensuring an attractive and user-friendly design.

Core Features:
User Management:
One of the central components of this project is the user management system. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and switch between profiles. Verification processes like email and SMS verification are integrated to ensure secure user sign-ups. Redis is employed to manage user sessions, providing faster authentication and enabling users to stay logged in even after page refreshes.

Book Library:
The book library is an essential feature of the project. Admins can upload and manage books in the library, while students can browse available books. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, price, and rental terms. Students can rent books directly from the library, and schools can also rent books in bulk. Admins have full control over the available book listings and can adjust prices, availability, and rental conditions as needed.

Ebook Management:
The platform also supports the management of eBooks. Admins can upload and manage eBook listings just as they would with physical books. Ebooks are available for rental or direct purchase by students and schools.

Pricing and Subscription Plans:
The app offers various subscription models, including monthly, quarterly, and annual plans for renting books and accessing eBooks. Different schools can choose a plan that best fits their needs and budget. The platform also includes a flexible pricing model where schools can order books on a rental cycle, allowing them to adjust their orders and usage based on their needs.

Gift Vouchers:
Gift vouchers are integrated into the platform to allow users to gift book rentals or subscriptions to others. Gift vouchers can be purchased by any user and redeemed by students or schools, making it easier for individuals or organizations to share access to the platform.

Admin and Student Dashboards:
Both admins and students have customized dashboards that cater to their specific needs. Admins can manage books, monitor user activity, adjust subscription prices, and generate reports. The admin dashboard provides a full overview of book rentals, active subscriptions, and payment histories. Students can view their rental history, browse books, and manage their subscriptions through the student dashboard. Both dashboards are built using React and Material UI for a consistent and intuitive user experience.

Dynamic Order Workflow:
A significant feature of the project is the dynamic order workflow. Students or schools can place orders for books, with the process divided into dynamic steps based on their selections (such as book availability, rental period, or payment method). This feature provides a tailored and smooth ordering process, ensuring users are guided step-by-step and can complete their transactions without confusion.

Future Enhancements:
Future versions of the platform could include features like advanced reporting, machine learning-based book recommendations, and enhanced social features for students to interact with each other. Additionally, the platform could be expanded to support mobile devices, offering apps for both iOS and Android.
